# Provisioning Engine

[![Test](https://github.com/SovereignEdgeEU-COGNIT/provisioning-engine/actions/workflows/rspec.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SovereignEdgeEU-COGNIT/provisioning-engine/actions/workflows/rspec.yaml)

Provisioning Engine acts as a entry point for the Device Runtime, instructs the Cloud-Edge Manager to spawn new FaaS/DaaS Runtimes and returns the endpoint back to the device. Afterwards, manages the lifetime of the FaaS/DaaS Runtimes
