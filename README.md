# Provisioning Engine

Provisioning Engine acts as a entry point for the Device Runtime, instructs the Cloud-Edge Manager to spawn new FaaS/DaaS Runtimes and returns the endpoint back to the device. Afterwards, manages the lifetime of the FaaS/DaaS Runtimes

## Installation

Execute `./install.sh`. The installer will take care of

- installing the required dependencies
- distributing the default configuration
- distributing the engine libraries and executables

By default, files are installed by symlinking from the github repository directory to the installation directories. You can use `./install.sh copy` to issue a file copy instead.

### Permissions

Write permissions are required on the following directories as a regular user

- `/opt`
- `/var/log/`

These require sudo

- `/etc`
- `/usr/local/bin`

### Dependencies

The following ruby gems are required. They will be installed automatically by `./install.sh`.

- sinatra
- logger
- json-schema
- opennebula

### Pre requirements

Each serverless runtime is associated to a running oneflow service. This service is the result of a service template instantiation. This template is a map from the functions defined in the runtime specification. It can be configured at `/etc/provision-engine/engine.conf`

```yaml
# nature -> A flow template with a FasS role called nature
# nature-s3 -> A flow template with a FasS role called nature and a DaaS role called s3
:mapping:
  :nature: 0
  :nature-s3: 3
```

## Service control

Execute `provision-engine start` and `provision-engine stop` to start the engine stop it respectively.

```log
 ~ î‚° provision-engine-server start

```

### Logs

The log files for the different engine components can be found at `/var/log/provision-engine/`. You can customize the log level at `/etc/provision-engine/engine.conf`

```yaml
# Log debug level
#   3 = ERROR, 2 = WARNING, 1 = INFO, 0 = DEBUG
#
# System
#   - file: log to log file
#   - syslog: log to syslog
:log:
  :level: 0
  :system: 'file'
```

Engine specific logs are written to the file `engine.log`. These contain information related to the API Calls

```log

```

Each time a call is issued, the engine uses a component called the CloudClient which takes care of interacting with OpenNebula. These interactions are logged to `CloudClient.log`

## Uninstall

Execute `./install.sh clean`. It will only remove the engine libraries. Gem dependencies and configuration will remain installed. Alternatively issue `./install.sh clean purge` to remove everything. The gems will be removed unless they are required by other gems already installed in the system.

## Development

Refer to [Specification Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_XLzS6TNsQoGvi5883g6Qi9s3EirahB1ADJEg34K0c/edit)

### Data Model

Provisioning Engine is stateless, all the state is saved in the Document Pool of OpenNebula.
